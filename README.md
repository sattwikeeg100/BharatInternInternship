<h1>Bharat Intern Internship Program (August-September)</h1>
<hr>
This is a 1-month long internship program where I was assigned with some tasks :
<h3>Task 1</h3>
<b>House Price Prediction:</b> Machine Learning model to predict house price using linear regression only Jupyter notebook code.
<h3>Task 2</h3>
<b>Iris Flowers Classification:</b> Predict the different species of flowers on the length of there petals and sepals only Jupyter notebook code.   
<br>
<p>I used the linear regression technique for these two machine learning projects to predict the required values. </p>
